# Machine_Learning_Practice

This repository is a collection of different apps I made related to data science and machine learning.

The apps included use popular ML libraries and are all coded in python. They are all my beginner attempts at Machine Learning that later helped me understand how to code larger, more complicated projects.

Hope you have fun reading through them!
